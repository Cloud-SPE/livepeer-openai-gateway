### layer-check ESLint plugin — stub only

- Opened: 2026-04-24
- Severity: medium
- Area: lint
- Description: `lint/layer-check/index.mjs` is currently a warn-and-exit-0 stub. The dependency rule from `docs/design-docs/architecture.md` (types → config → repo → service → runtime → ui + providers) is not yet enforced mechanically — CI will pass on violations.
- Remediation: dedicated exec-plan to author an AST-based layer-check (and the companion `no-cross-cutting-import`, `zod-at-boundary`, `no-secrets-in-logs`, `file-size` rules described in `lint/README.md`).
- Resolved: _(open)_

### `src/types/` shape lint not enforced

- Opened: 2026-04-24
- Severity: low
- Area: lint / types
- Description: 0002-types-and-zod calls for a lint that asserts every file in `src/types/` exports both a Zod schema and the inferred `z.infer` type. Currently relying on code review. Convention is respected by every file authored in 0002.
- Remediation: add as a rule in the ESLint plugin work (see above).
- Resolved: _(open)_
